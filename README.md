# Next Word Predictor using LSTM

This project is a **Next Word Prediction** tool powered by an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network built with TensorFlow/Keras. Given a starting sentence, the model predicts the next word(s) based on a trained corpus.

## Features

- Train an LSTM model on any custom `.txt` file
- Save and reuse trained model â€” no need to retrain every time
- Built entirely in Python with Keras and TensorFlow

   git clone https://github.com/CrAnish07/Next_Word_Predictor.git
   cd Next_Word_Predictor
   ```

2. Install required packages
   
   ```bash
    pip install tensorflow numpy
    ```

4. Prepare your text corpus
   
   ```bash
    Replace sample1.txt with your own .txt file if desired.
   ```
   
6. Run the script
   
   ```bash
    python nxt_word_predictor.py
    ```
